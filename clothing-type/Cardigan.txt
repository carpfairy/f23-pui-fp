The best sweater is cozy, comfortable, and warm. Merino wool is a great option. It’s purportedly less itchy than some other wool. It’s a natural fiber and hypoallergenic, which means it’s good for both you and the environment.

Wool can be expensive and hard to take care of. Another great option is cotton. Cotton is breathable, durable, and easy to care for. It’s a natural material made from plants, which means it's biodegradable and renewable.

Please for the love of god check if your SHEIN sweater is made from acrylic before you buy it. That stuff is plastic. It burns when heated too high. And it stretches. If it’s $8 you know it’s not ethically produced. If you’re going to buy acrylic, at least try UNIQLO first…
