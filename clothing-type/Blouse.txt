Tencel is the best material for a blouse. Itâ€™s exceptional at moisture absorption and release, making it comfortable and sweat-friendly. Tencel production also involves a closed-loop process, which is great for the environment. 

Another great option for a blouse is cotton. Cotton is durable and sweat-friendly, making it a comfortable choice for office wear. It also might give a more elevated aesthetic than other options.
