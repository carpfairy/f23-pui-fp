A blend of natural fibers such as wool and Tencel stands out as a top-notch option. Wool offers excellent breathability and moisture-wicking properties, ensuring comfort without compromising on style. It will also keep you warm during colder months. Tencel, made from sustainably sourced wood pulp, complements wool by enhancing the blazer's drape and softness.

Polyester is also a popular choice for blazers. Well-crafted polyester may offer a more expensive look than other options, but cheap polyester will just be ew. And your boss will think that too.
