Down is a naturally insulating material, made from the soft plumage of ducks or geese. Its exceptional warmth-to-weight ratio makes it a necessity for cold temperatures, and it is the best option for winter jackets and coats. Downâ€™s loftiness allows for effective heat retention while being lightweight. It is easy to compress and packs small. However, down clothing can be expensive. It also loses some of its insulating ability when wet, and can take a long time to dry. It also requires special care.
