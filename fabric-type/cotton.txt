Cotton is a natural fiber, spun from the cotton plant and pressed into clothing. It is the worldâ€™s most popular and versatile textile. 

Cotton is often the best choice for clothing. It is hardy and durable, meaning it will last a long time in your closet. It is warm, yet breathable and sweat-absorbent. It does not promote odor-causing bacteria when compared to synthetic fibers like polyester.

Although cotton is the most environmentally friendly fabric, opt for organic and recycled for even better sustainability.
