Polyurethane, or PU, is commonly used as in synthetic leather or faux leather. It is waterproof, durable, and is a low-maintenance cruelty-free alternative to genuine leather. However, it lacks the same longevity and breathability. It also does not develop the same character and patina over time like leather does.
