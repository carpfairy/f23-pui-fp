Viscose, another type of rayon, is derived from wood pulp, making it a semi-synthetic fabric. Viscose is breathable and absorbent, making it a popular choice for summer or active wear. It isnâ€™t stretchy on its own, can be when blended with stretchier fabrics. It drapes well, and can be an affordable substitute for silk. However, it is not very durable, may shrink with washing, and is prone to staining.
