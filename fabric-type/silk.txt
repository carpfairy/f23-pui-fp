Silk is a natural fiber made from the larvae of the silk moth. Silk is a high quality material prized for its softness, sheen, and temperature-regulating properties. It is a popular choice for elegant and lightweight garments. It can be expensive and delicate, and may require special care since it is not as durable as some synthetic alternatives.
