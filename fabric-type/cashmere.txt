Cashmere is a luxurious natural fiber obtained from the soft undercoat of cashmere goats. It is known for its softness, lightweight warmth, and breathability. It is one of the best options for cold weather clothing, such as sweaters and cardigans. It is roughly eight times warmer than sheep's wool. However, it can be expensive and difficult to maintain.
