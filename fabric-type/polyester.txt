Polyester is the most popular fabric in the fashion industry because of its cheapness and versatility. It is easy to care for, durable, and wrinkle-resistant. It is also inexpensive to purchase polyester clothing. However, it is not breathable, and promotes the production of odor causing bacteria. Avoid in exercise clothing.
