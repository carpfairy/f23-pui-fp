Wool is a natural fiber sourced from the coats of sheep. Wool is a great choice for winter clothing, as it is incredibly warm while being breathable and sweat friendly. It is wrinkle-resistant and lightweight. When properly cared for, a wool garment can last a lifetime. However, wool clothing can be expensive and difficult to maintain. Certain wool items can also be itchy and uncomfortable when worn against bare skin.
