Acrylic is a synthetic fiber made from reacting petroleum (coal-based) chemicals with a variety of monomers. It is one of the least breathable forms of textiles, which means it is often used for winter clothing such as sweaters. It has a wool-like texture, making it a cheaper alternative. It retains its shape and resists shrinkage and wrinkles. However, it is prone to static and pilling, and is not a durable material. It is heat sensitive and melts when it burns, and is dissolved by nail polish remover.
