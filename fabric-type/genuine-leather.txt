Genuine leather is a natural material sourced from animal hides. It is prized for its durability, comfort, breathability, value retention, and timeless appeal. It is one of the only materials that looks better with wear. Over time, genuine leather develops a unique patina. Despite its luxurious qualities, genuine leather is often expensive. It can also be sensitive to moisture and sunlight. Since it is sourced from animals, this means it is not cruelty-free.
