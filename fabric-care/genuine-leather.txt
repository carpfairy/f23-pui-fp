Genuine Leather needs to be handled with care to preserve its quality. Follow care instructions on the tag. Wipe off any spills immediately with a damp cloth and use a mild leather cleaner for deeper cleaning. Keep leather items away from direct sunlight to prevent fading and store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid exposing leather to water, and never machine wash or tumble dry leather garments.
