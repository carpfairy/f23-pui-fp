Down can have a complicated care process. Read care instructions on the label carefully.

Generally, down items should be machine washed in cold water with a down-specific detergent. Use a front-loading washer to prevent compression. To dry, tumble dry on low heat with a few clean tennis balls or dryer balls to fluff the down clusters. It's crucial to ensure the down item is thoroughly dry to prevent mildew and maintain its insulation properties. Regularly fluff and shake the item during drying to redistribute the down evenly. Avoid hanging down items, as this can lead to loss of loft.
