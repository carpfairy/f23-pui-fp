Read care instructions on the tag. Dry clean, or hand wash in cold water using a gentle detergent. Avoid wringing or stretching the fabric. Instead, gently press out excess water and lay it flat to dry on a clean, dry towel. Store cashmere items folded to prevent stretching and maintain their shape.
