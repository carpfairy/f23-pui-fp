Polyurethane, often used in faux leather and stretchy fabrics, requires gentle care. Wipe the surface clean with a damp cloth for regular maintenance. Avoid exposing polyurethane to heat or direct sunlight, as it may cause the material to crack or fade. Do not machine wash or tumble dry polyurethane garments.
