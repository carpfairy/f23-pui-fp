Silk is very delicate, and should be dry cleaned. It can also be carefully hand washed at home in cold water with a mild detergent. Avoid wringing or twisting. Instead, gently press out excess water and air-dry away from direct sunlight. 

To iron, flip the garment inside out. Iron on low heat setting while the fabric is still slightly damp.
