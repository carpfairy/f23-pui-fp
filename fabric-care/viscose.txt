Read care instructions on tag, as recommendations may vary based on viscose content. Viscose can be machine washed in a laundry net. Otherwise, hand wash rayon items in cold water with a mild detergent and dry flat to prevent stretching and damage.

Iron on a low heat setting if necessary, using a cloth between the iron and the fabric.
