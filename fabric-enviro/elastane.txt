Elastic is a synthetic fiber made from petrochemicals, making it non-biodegradable and environmentally taxing. Its production process involves energy-intensive procedures, contributing to carbon emissions. With limited recycling options, elastane poses challenges for a circular fashion economy. Manufacturers are exploring alternatives like plant-based elastane to mitigate these environmental impacts.
