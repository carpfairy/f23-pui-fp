Silk is the only natural filament fiber, with filament from one cocoon measuring up to 1000 yards. Silk production relies on the growth of mulberry trees, which are used to feed the silkworms. Silkworms are also boiled and killed in the process of making silk, which can raise ethical concerns. About 3,000 cocoons are used to make one yard of silk. One hectare (about 2.5 acres) of mulberry trees produces enough food for worms to produce about 85 lbs of silk.

Generally speaking, silk is considered a more sustainable fiber. It is a renewable resource, can biodegrade, and uses less water and chemicals than many other fibers.
