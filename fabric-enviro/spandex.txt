Spandex is a synthetic fabric created from petrochemicals, meaning it is not biodegradable. Since it is synthetic, it requires synthetic dyes which are “notoriously one of the most polluting factors in textile manufacturing”. The toxic chemicals used in spandex production can also irritate the skin. With limited recycling options, spandex poses challenges for a circular fashion economy.
