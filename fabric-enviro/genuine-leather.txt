Genuine leather, a byproduct of the meat industry, has a complex sustainability profile. While it repurposes waste from the food sector, the environmental impact arises from the intensive water and energy consumption in the tanning process. Sustainable leather initiatives focus on improving tanning practices, utilizing vegetable tanning methods, and promoting the use of alternative materials such as mushroom leather or plant-based synthetics.
