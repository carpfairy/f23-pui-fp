Genuine leather is a biodegradable, renewable material made from the hide of cows. Cow farming is the largest source of methane production in the US, responsible for 31% of yearly emissions. Methane traps 80 times more heat in the atmosphere than CO2 for 20 years after its release.

Tanneries often use pollutants, such as lime, sulfides, and acids, to add finish to leather. Improper waste disposal can lead to the contamination of surrounding soil and water sources. This harms nearby crops and those who consume them, as well as aquatic ecosystems.

<b>Ethical Concerns:</b> Leather is a byproduct of the meat industry. This means that cows are not killed for the specific purpose of leather harvesting; rather, they are slaughtered for the meat industry, and then their hides enter the leather supply chain. The meat industry in general has been accused of incredibly inhumane farming practices.
