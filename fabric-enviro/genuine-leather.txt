GEnuine leather, which is typically produced from the hide of cows, is biodegradable and technically renewable. Leather is a byproduct of the meat industry. This means that cows are not killed for the specific purpose of leather harvesting. Rather, they are killed for the meat industry, and their skin (which can not be used) is then harvested for leather. While the leather industry helps repurpose waste from the food sector, it still has a complex sustainability profile. 

Cow farming is resource-heavy, as they need plenty of land and water to live on. Cows are also the top methane emissions source in the US, contributing to a whopping 31.5% of all methane emissions per year. Methane traps heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, making it 80 times more harmful than CO2 for 20 years after it is released. Furthermore, tanneries often use pollutants, such as salt, lime sludge, sulfides, and acids in the process of finishing leather. Improper waste disposal can lead to contamination of surrounding soil and water sources. This causes harm to nearby crops and those who consume them, as well as to aquatic ecosystems. 

There is also the ethical issue when it comes to cow farming. There is a plethora of evidence available condemning the practice for being incredibly inhumane.
