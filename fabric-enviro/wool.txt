Wool is a natural fiber, meaning it is biodegradable. Wool usually refers to the coats of sheep, although it can also be sourced from goats, camels, alpacas, llama, yaks, possums, rabbits, and more. The most popular breed for creating wool garments is Merino. 

While wool is a renewable resource, the production and farming required can leave significant negative impacts on the environment and animal welfare. The environmental impact is determined heavily by farming practices, and it is up to farmersâ€™ discretion that the grasslands used are maintained.
