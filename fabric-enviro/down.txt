Down is a natural material made from the plumage of ducks or geese, meaning it is biodegradable. However, the lining or shell of what maintains the down material may be synthetic and nonbiodegradable. 

According to the International Down and Feather Testing Laboratory, “Down and feathers have the lowest carbon footprint of any other fill material, both natural and synthetic.” While natural and biodegradable, the ethical concerns surrounding down production are significant. Traditional methods involve live-plucking or force-feeding geese and ducks, raising animal welfare issues. To address these concerns, the Responsible Down Standard (RDS) and the Global Traceable Down Standard (TDS) have been introduced, ensuring that down is sourced ethically and responsibly. These standards prohibit live-plucking and force-feeding, promoting humane treatment of animals in the down supply chain. Opting for products certified with these standards is crucial for consumers seeking sustainable and ethically sourced down products.
