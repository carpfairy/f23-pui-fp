Cashmere is a natural fiber, meaning it is biodegradable. It is made from the undercoats of goats, which means it is renewable. However, poor farming practices can lead to overgrazing and land degredation. It can take up to four goats to produce the cashmere needed for one sweater. Since it is sourced primarily from the Himalayan region, transportation can produce high carbon emissions. Virgin cashmere has the highest environmental impact -- roughly 100 times that of wool.

There are ethical concerns when it comes to harvesting the cashmere off goats. While the animal naturally sheds their hairs, the demand for cashmere is often higher than what they naturally produce. Consequently, to collect hair faster, goats are brushed with metal combs. This can be a stressful and pain-inducing process. The RSPCA, an international animal welfare group, has raised concerns about the treatment of goats on cashmere farms.
