Because cotton is a natural fiber, it is also sustainable, renewable, and biodegradable. However, it is also very water intensive to cultivate and process.

Organic cotton is produced without the use of pesticides and toxic chemicals that poison water supplies and farm workers. Organic cotton also carries no residue from chemicals as none are used in the harvesting and farming processes. This means it is a great option for those with skin allergies.
