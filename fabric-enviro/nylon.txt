Nylon is a synthetic fabric, which means it is not biodegradable. It is nonrenewable and created from petrochemicals, a type of fossil fuel. Nylon production is energy and water intensive, and emits nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Because it is a type of plastic, it contributes to persistent microplastic pollution.
