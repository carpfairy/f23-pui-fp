Nylon is a synthetic fabric made of petrochemicals, meaning it is neither biodegradable nor nonrenewable. Nylon production is energy and water intensive, and emits nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Because it is a type of plastic, it contributes to persistent microplastic pollution.
