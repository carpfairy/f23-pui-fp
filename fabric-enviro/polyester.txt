Polyester is a synthetic fabric, meaning it is not biodegradable. It is the least sustainable fabric in the clothing industry, and contributes to the 100 million tons of clothing that ends up in landfills per year. It is a plastic material that is created from petrochemicals, and it can shed up to 700,000 tiny plastic fibers in each wash cycle. While plastic-based fibers do not require agricultural land, it still contributes to carbon emissions and persistent microplastic pollution. Countries like China, India, and the United States are major contributors to the global polyester industry, underscoring the need for sustainable alternatives to mitigate its environmental impact.
