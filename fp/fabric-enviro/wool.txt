Wool usually refers to the coats of sheep, although it can also be sourced from goats, camels, alpacas, llama, yaks, possums, rabbits, and more. The most popular breed for creating wool garments is Merino. The environmental impact of wool production is determined heavily by farming practices, and it is up to farmersâ€™ discretion that the grasslands used are maintained.
