While down is a natural material, down clothing often has a lining or shell that may be synthetic and nonbiodegradable.

<b>Ethical Concerns:</b> Traditional down harvesting involves force feeding ducks and geese, before live plucking their plumage. These are unhealthy and painful processes. When shopping down, opt for clothing that is RDS (Responsible Down Standard) or TDS (Global Traceable Down Standard) certified. This ensures that the down was sourced from a farm that does not force feed or live pluck. </div>
