Polyester production is less land and water intensive than alternative fabrics, such as cotton. However, because polyester is the most popular material used in fast fashion and also not biodegradable, it is the main contributor to the 100 million tons of clothing that end up in landfills each year. Polyester sheds up to 700,000 microplastic fibers in each wash cycle. This can end up in your lungs when you do laundry.
