Silk is a natural filament fiber made from the cocoons of silk moths. It is one of the most environmentally friendly fabrics in the industry. One cocoon can produce up to 1,000 yards of silk. About 3,000 cocoons are used to make one yard of silk. One hectare (2.5 acres) of mulberry trees produces enough food for silkworms to produce about 85lbs of silk.

<b>Ethical Concerns:</b> In order to produce silk, silkworms are boiled. Silkworms have been farmed and domesticated to the point where they can not survive on their own, and rely on humans for caretaking.
