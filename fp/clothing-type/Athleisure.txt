"for workout clothes, you want something that either absorbs sweat well, or wicks it away to avoid odor. please please please avoid polyester. it will make you stinky and feel gross. if you're looking for something form-fitting, opt for <b>nylon, lycra, elastane,</b> or <b>spandex</b>. or, a <b>cotton</b> tee will work great." -caroline
