Polyester is the most popular fabric in the fashion industry due to its versatility and low cost. Polyester is wrinkle-resistant and easy to care for. However, it is not breathable, and its durability is compromised over time. Polyester clothing promotes the production of odor causing bacteria, so stay away from it when shopping for warm weather and exercise clothing.
